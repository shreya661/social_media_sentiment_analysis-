# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
A begineer-social media sentiment analysis this project explores how people react based on the post like positive and neative sentiments using python and simple visulization. 
This project focuses on the social media data to understand user sentiment across different platform.
The main purpose of this project is to practise pythonwith data analysis and data visulizations concepts.
In this project uses basic python library like matplotlib,pandas,numpy,seaborn,etc., help to interact with dataset
The dataset is take from kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset/data

## Objectives 
1. Understand how sentiment analysis works on social media data.
2. Analyze the distribution of postive and negative tweents fromt the data.
3. Compare user activity across different social media platforms
4. Visualize insights using charts and graphs
5. Improve hands-on skills in Python and data analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python – for data processing and analysis
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Plotly – for interactive visualizations
- Seaborn – for statistical visualizations
- Matplotlib – for basic charts
- Jupyter Notebook – for development and execution

## Visulizations

## Key Insights
- Positive sentiment appears more frequently than negative sentiment  
- Some platforms show higher user activity  
- A few countries contribute most of the social media posts
- Data visualization helps in quickly identifying sentiment trends

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install the required Python libraries  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
4. Run all cells to view the analysis and visualizations  

## Future Improvements
- Include neutral sentiment analysis  
- Apply machine learning models for prediction  
- Use real-time social media data
